Data about the languages present in newspapers was generated by harvesting a sample of articles from each newspaper using the Trove API, and then using language detection software on the OCRd text of each article. The method is documented in <a href=\"https://glam-workbench.net/trove-newspapers/find-non-english-newspapers/\">this notebook</a> in the GLAM Workbench.</p> <p>There are two files:</p> <ul> <li><code>newspapers_non_english.csv</code> – list of the main languages detected for each newspaper with non-English language content</li> <li><code>non-english-newspapers.md</code> – a markdown formatted list of all the newspapers with non-English language content</li> </ul> <h2 id=\"newspapers_non_english.csv\"><code>newspapers_non_english.csv</code></h2> <p>The dataset contains the following columns:</p> <table> <thead> <tr class=\"header\"> <th>Column</th> <th>Contents</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr class=\"odd\"> <td><code>id</code></td> <td>newspaper id</td> </tr> <tr class=\"even\"> <td><code>title</code></td> <td>newspaper title</td> </tr> <tr class=\"odd\"> <td><code>language</code></td> <td>language code</td> </tr> <tr class=\"even\"> <td><code>proportion</code></td> <td>proportion of articles in this language</td> </tr> <tr class=\"odd\"> <td><code>number</code></td> <td>number of articles sampled</td> </tr> <tr class=\"even\"> <td><code>language_full</code></td> <td>full language name</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id=\"non-english-newspapers.md\"><code>non-english-newspapers.md</code></h2> <p>This is <a href=\"non-english-newspapers.md\">a markdown-formatted list</a> created by grouping the dataset by newspaper title.
